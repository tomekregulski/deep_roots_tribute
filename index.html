                <h2>About the Deep Roots Ensemble</h2>
                <p>
                    The Deep Roots Ensemble is a chamber music group which focuses on studying and performing Traditional American Music.  It was formed in 2015 by Taylor Ackley and Alison Rowe with the goal of bringing this rich tradition of music making into concert halls and academic settings. Since then they have performed extensively in the New York area, the Midwest and the Pacific Northwest along with giving lecture recitals, workshops and masterclasses.  The Deep Roots Ensemble is also dedicated to the performance of new music.  As a group they perform contemporary works which draw upon American roots music and its members are among the most active performers of new music at Stony Brook University. Their debut album Songs from the Bitterroot is released through the 4Tay Records label.
