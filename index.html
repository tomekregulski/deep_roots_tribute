                        The Deep Roots Ensemble is a chamber music group which focuses on studying and performing Traditional American Music.  It was formed in 2015 by Taylor Ackley and Alison Rowe with the goal of bringing this rich tradition of music making into concert halls and academic settings. Since then they have performed extensively in the New York area, the Midwest and the Pacific Northwest along with giving lecture recitals, workshops and masterclasses.  The Deep Roots Ensemble is also dedicated to the performance of new music.  As a group they perform contemporary works which draw upon American roots music and its members are among the most active performers of new music at Stony Brook University. Their debut album Songs from the Bitterroot is released through the 4Tay Records label.

                            This debut album by the Deep Roots Ensemble brings together the powerful story telling and improvisation of traditional American music with the nuance and expression of a classical chamber ensemble through the original songs of Taylor Ackley.

                            This work builds upon the approach heard in our first release, Songs from the Bitterroot, blending American folk and roots song with classical chamber music and jazz improvisation, while expanding our instrumental and creative scope. Exploring themes of love, family, sin, and salvation, Hard Tellin' captures a more unique, refined and cohesive approach to making music.
